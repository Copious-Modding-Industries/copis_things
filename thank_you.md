### Alias
Wether it be crab champions, Noita, Nova Drift, or whatever else (except rainworld, I'm holding off on spoilers still :p ), I've had such a blast spending time in your chat, I love the noita challenge runs, various games, and even just the small talk that goes on in your channel. Keep up the awesome work, you're a really fun guy. I've got my eyes out for sky islands thanks to you :aliasbSus:

### Bruham
I don't know how to put it into words, but you're one of my biggest inspirations. Like, ever. Your mods are incredible, and you're also cool as hell. To think I'd meet someone coming up with such amazing lore and creations, I eagerly wait for all your projects. You've directly inspired some of my works like twitchy lua, and P2K is unmatched in style and is what drove me to finally want to learn GUI properly. N40k is a joy, and put together with such style it's no wonder people are always asking for progress updates. Piecing together lore, digging around, you've brought me lots of joy and ideas, I appreciate all your work and our conversations a lot more than I make it seem.

### Conga
Wow. Mocreeps, and now Apotheosis? I almost feel like I'm falling behind in modding here. But in all honesty, the amount of stuff you get done, with high quality in such an efficient manner is absolutely staggering. I look up to your mods as a standard of polish and quality, I don't think I could ever balance as well as you. You're also just such a cool person outside of modding, and it brightens my day to see you posting ultrakill memes or meming in chat, I don't know how you manage to do so much and still have the time to goof around and consistently make banger mods. It's still funny seeing our first real "encounter" in squirrelly's server, I still find it super cool how you're into game design, hearing you discuss design stuff wether it be about a game or a mod, is still super interesting. You're a jack of all trades when it comes to enemies, spells, biomes, and all that, you never cease to impress me.

### Dexter
I don't even understand most of your unsafe wizardry, but I'm greatful for all of it. Component explorer is a godsend, and the things you've done for us modders cannot be condensed into a single little message. You're also a massive inspiration for coming up with modding tech, I don't think I could have ever come across the game mode mod trick without meeting you. Thank you for everything, and helping bring my silly twitchy lua mod to life. I have a deep respect for you.

### Evaisa
While I don't get to talk to you as much as I'd like to, the interactions we have are super fun. You're such a talented modder and I'd have never gotten as far as I have if not for all your brilliant mods, to this day you're still impressing me with insane projects like noita arena. You're funny, amazing at modding, and you made me change my pfp for the first time in years. I've looked up to you and your mods since I've joined the modding community, and you've consistently shown me just how much we can do with Noita if we try hard enough. Thank you for being so helpful, witty, and just plain cool. You're one of a kind, and in the coolest way.

### Fury
While I haven't talked with you one on one nearly as much as lots of other people, I think you're super cool. I love the passion you have for the games you play, and the videos you've made on noita have been part of the reason I've fallen in love with the game so much. Even when I'm not chatting, I love to lurk and watch, you're entertaining as hell, all the time. You've brought some amazing games to my attention, you've done amazing things. Keep burning bright, dude!

### Goki
You're no longer a part of this community, but I'd have never been modding if not for your mods being outdated now. It feels weird to talk to someone who isn't there, but to keep things brief, you're really important to me. Thank you.

### Graham
Thank you for being so damn cool, and having such cool ideas. Your mods mean a lot more to me than it may seem, graham's things is really well put together and I still look up to it as an example of a mod which fits vanilla's themes while having lots of unique traits, unlockables, and all sorts of other goodies. I'm really happy to have been able to help you with your mods, wether it be through sprites or code, your ideas are brilliant. Keep up the good work friend, and pet freddie for me. Thanks for being an awesome friend, and putting up with my absolute lack of skill in pizza tower and isaac. I genuinely really enjoy having you around, it's crazy how we have so much in common, even down to our birthdays. Thanks for being who you are, you're epic.

### Horscht
I adore your mods. Missile mina, Anvil of destiny, all of them. They're really fun, cool, and innovative. I appreciate everything you've done for the modding community, and I'd have never gotten so far with GUI if it weren't for you. Thank you for everything, and for being a huge inspiration. To go back and update anvil's API so us newer modders can support it, you've done a lot for us. You're incredible, and I will always look up to you and your work.

### Sosig
I haven't gotten to talk to you so much, but you're absolutely amazing. Your newer content mods are bafflingly, amazing, the perks you've made are freaking cool. More stuff, I'm speechless. Alt biomes is to this day one of my favourite mods, I'm super thankful you're a part of this community. You're a prime example of creativity and quality, and your mods show just how capable you are.

### Spicy
Your icons are amazing. I don't even have words to describe just how damn epic they are. Seeing this little texture pack show up one day out of nowhere caught my interest, and I'm really glad it did. You're fun, cool, and your art skills are better than anything I could ever manage. Getting to work out the code for your mods is an honor I never thought I'd get, it's been a fun challenge trying to one-up my own code to speed up the load times. How you manage to make such banger icons and texture packs so quickly eludes me, and it's always a joy to have you in VC, wether it be spriting or playing games. You've got to show me some modded terraria stuff some time, I'm really curious about all that. Thanks for making such cool textures, and letting me bash my head against vscode more. Your sprites are almost as cool as you are!

### Spoop
I know I have such a skill issue I can barely get through the game with worse enemies on, but the desire to see what absolute batshit insane things you've put further down keeps driving me to play more of your mod. You're one of the most dedicated artists/modders I've seen, when anyone brings up anything enemy related I'm almost counting down how long until you post some funny gif or something. I am absolutely impressed by your pixel art skills, I have no clue how you do it. Oh and trust me, bloodling will be added soon enough, I didn't forget :^) It's always a joy to hear your funny sounds in vc, or hang out while you make lists and mess around. You're a gem, keep shining, friend.

### Squirrelly
It feels so weird knowing there's someone who lives so close to `[HOSPITAL]`, but even so, you're still really freaking awesome. I know it's been a while since you've modded, but being a part of the journey making your mod was an epic experience, I have no regrets getting to know you and helping out with chemical curiosities. You sending me memes out of nowhere brings me joy, and I'm thankful you put up with my bullshit on the minecraft server even with my psi shenanigans. It's always fun seeing whatever shenanigans you get up to in off topic chat, you're so damn cool. Thanks for being the coolest person I know within a 100km radius(?), and having really based opinions. 

### Tanksy
Nothing brings my mood up like getting to hang out with you and watch your streams, you're really funny and unique. I love the entire aesthetic of your channel and the community you've built up, and I've gotten to know some really neat people while hanging out. Whatever game you play, you make it really damn entertaining. Getting to play barotrauma with you is an unforgettable experience, every time it's so chaotic and fun, and that terraria server was so goofy and a blast to play on. You've got an amazing taste in music, and noitavania is still so freaking cool to me, I have lots of memories playing it. You're awesome as hell, it's as shrimple as that.

### Yourdoom
Your pixel art is godly. To this day I look at the art you've made, and it fills me with inspiration. It's thanks to you that I strive to improve. You make incredible designs and artwork, I could only hope to get close to that level of skill. When I think of good pixel art, you come to mind. You're really freaking cool, and so is everything you're involved in. Keep up the great work dude, you're incredible.
