I've been thinking for a while about adding some homage content to the various players, contributors, and friends I've come across while making copith.
Of course, I can't go back years and some people have moved on/lost contact, but the least I can do is this now, no point in delaying it further
It's still not something I'm 100% sure on but I'd be happy to discuss it if you do read this file
Variants on existing spells, entirely original spells, etc, I like to be challenged so don't hold back on your ideas if you want them
Could be something in the vein of "Jim's Magic Missile" if you know what I mean, doesn't have to be named after you though
Contact me if you want, I feel like I should be doing more for all the incredible people around who've put up with the rocky dev cycle of this mod
